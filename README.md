# What is Lattice?
Lattice is a framework for rapid prototyping,
can be used to get your application up and
running in a few hours, but it is also aimed
at better maintainability, so if your project
proves success you can continue developing
your codebase towards your more specialized
needs.

### Plugins
lattice follows a micro kernel pluggable
architecture.

plugins give you the freedom and flexibility
to customize your app to meet your specific
project requirements and as to have less code
as possible.

# Planned features
- More declarative style (in-progress)
